//_Gear Protocol
## Comprehensive toolkit for quick dApp creation
Gear Protocol offers exceptional technical capabilities and allows dApp developers to focus on their projects rather than building and operating an entirely new blockchain from scratch.
  * ### [Actor Model[Learn more]A well-known approach used in high frequency parallel computation, this model ensures asynchronous messaging and memory parallelism by design.Ensuring security, anonymity, transaction efficiency and as a result network speed, it stands as on of the core pillars of the Gear Protocol. Want to learn more about how it works? Check our Wiki.](https://www.gear-tech.io/<https:/wiki.vara.network/docs/about/technology/actor-model>)
  * ### [Persistent Memory[Learn more]The Persistent Memory concept is another novelty brought by Gear Protocol to Web3. It provides an innovative solution to program storage with clever and effective memory virtualization techniques. All you need is to code regular programs like in Web2 world, no need to be an expert in blockchain-specific programming. Check this Wiki to find more detailed information.](https://www.gear-tech.io/<https:/wiki.vara.network/docs/about/technology/persist-memory>)
  * ### [WASM (WebAssembly)[Learn more]Offering Native speed execution and support for standard programming languages, WebAssembly has been integrated by Gear Protocol to create an environment for fast, secure and flexible execution not just for smart-contracts but for onchain programs. Opening the door to new generation of applications. Sounds interesting? Check Wiki to dive in!](https://www.gear-tech.io/<https:/wiki.vara.network/docs/about/technology/WASM>)
  * ### [Gear.exe[Learn more]Gear.exe is a Vara-based, bridge-free runtime network compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem. It provides unlimited parallelism and an expressive application development platform to bring together the users and liquidity of Ethereum and its top L2s. We are building an Ethereum ecosystem with more than $60 billion in TVL and $2 billion in revenue. Imagine Solana's UX level with 10x TVL![Gear.exe illustration](https://www.gear-tech.io/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhomepage%2Fposter-eth-exe.png&w=1920&q=100)Your browser does not support the video tag.](https://www.gear-tech.io/</gear-exe>)
